This is a short introduction and quickstart for the PySpark DataFrame API. PySpark DataFrames are lazily evaluated. They are implemented on top of RDDs. When Spark transforms data, it does not immediately compute the transformation but plans how to compute later. When actions such as collect() are explicitly called, the computation starts. This notebook shows the basic usages of the DataFrame, geared mainly for new users. You can run the latest version of these examples by yourself on a live notebook here.

There is also other useful information in Apache Spark documentation site, see the latest version of Spark SQL and DataFrames, RDD Programming Guide, Structured Streaming Programming Guide, Spark Streaming Programming Guide and Machine Learning Library (MLlib) Guide.

PySpark applications start with initializing SparkSession which is the entry point of PySpark as below. In case of running it in PySpark shell via pyspark executable, the shell automatically creates the session in the variable spark for users.
